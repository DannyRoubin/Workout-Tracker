# Workout-Tracker

## App Description

This app serves to be a workout tracker where users are able to log their exercises and be able to track the amount of time each day they spent working out as well as how many pounds they worked with during a workout

## Motivation Behind the project/why I built it

My motivation behind this project was to create an app which I could use when I go to the gym to keep better track of the workouts I'm doing and how much time I'm spending there.

## What I learned from this project

With this project I was able to learn to work with mongoDB which wasn't as difficult as I expected it to be since there were many similarities to SQL

## App usage (local Installation)

To use this app simply clone this repo, then perform an npm i in gitbash/terminal.Next, you will seed the data by opening your terminal/gitbash and running npm run seed. This should create the database and seed the data in there. After seeding the data you should be able to run npm run start and the app will begin
